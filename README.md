# Decryption
Decrypt an encrypted text using specific character substitute. This code is only limited to substituting vowels.

## How to run the program 
  
  Think of a word, phrase, or sentence. Then change the vowels into these corresponding symbols:
  
  "*" for a, 
  
  "&" for e, 
  
  "#" for i, 
  
  "+" for o, 
  
  "!" for u, 
  
  Input the word, phrase, or sentence with the changed vowels.
  
  The program should print an output with the correct letter substitution.
